# Building Zed for FreeBSD
FreeBSD is not currently a supported platform, so this guide is a work in progress.
## Repository
Clone the Zed repository .
## Dependencies
- Install the necessary system packages and rustup: script/freebsd If preferred, you can inspect script/freebsd and perform the steps manually.
## Building from source
Once the dependencies are installed, you can build Zed using Cargo .
For a debug build of the editor:
```
cargo run
```
And to run the tests:
```
cargo test --workspace
```
In release mode, the primary user interface is the cli crate. You can run it in development with:
```
cargo run -p cli
```
### WebRTC Notice
Building webrtc-sys on FreeBSD currently fails due to missing upstream support and unavailable prebuilt binaries. As a result, collaboration features that depend on WebRTC (audio calls and screen sharing) are temporarily disabled.
See [Issue #15309: FreeBSD Support] and [Discussion #29550: Unofficial FreeBSD port for Zed] for more.
## Troubleshooting
### Cargo errors claiming that a dependency is using unstable features
Try cargo clean and cargo build .
