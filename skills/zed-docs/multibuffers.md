# Multibuffers
One of the superpowers Zed gives you is the ability to edit multiple files simultaneously. When combined with multiple cursors, this makes wide-ranging refactors significantly faster.
## Editing in a multibuffer
Editing a multibuffer is the same as editing a normal file. Changes you make will be reflected in the open copies of that file in the rest of the editor, and you can save all files with workspace: save (bound to cmd-s on macOS, ctrl-s on Windows/Linux, or :w in Vim mode).
When in a multibuffer, it is often useful to use multiple cursors to edit every file simultaneously. If you want to edit a few instances, you can select them with the mouse ( option-click on macOS, alt-click on Window/Linux) or the keyboard. cmd-d on macOS, ctrl-d on Windows/Linux, or gl in Vim mode will select the next match of the word under the cursor.
When you want to edit all matches you can select them by running the editor: select all matches command ( cmd-shift-l on macOS, ctrl-shift-l on Windows/Linux, or g a in Vim mode).
## Navigating to the Source File
While you can easily edit files in a multibuffer, navigating directly to the source file is often beneficial. You can accomplish this by clicking on any of the divider lines between excerpts or by placing your cursor in an excerpt and executing the editor: open excerpts command. It’s key to note that if multiple cursors are being used, the command will open the source file positioned under each cursor within the multibuffer.
Additionally, if you prefer to use the mouse and would like to double-click on an excerpt to open it, you can enable this functionality with the setting: "double_click_in_multibuffer": "open" .
## Project search
To start a search run the pane: deploy search command ( cmd-shift-f on macOS, ctrl-shift-f on Windows/Linux, or g/ in Vim mode). After the search has completed, the results will be shown in a new multibuffer. There will be one excerpt for each matching line across the whole project.
## Diagnostics
If you have a language server installed, the diagnostics pane can show you all errors across your project. You can open it by clicking on the icon in the status bar, or running the diagnostics: deploy command ( cmd-shift-m on macOS, ctrl-shift-m on Windows/Linux, or :clist in Vim mode).
## Find References
If you have a language server installed, you can find all references to the symbol under the cursor with the editor: find all references command ( cmd-click on macOS, ctrl-click on Windows/Linux, or g A in Vim mode.
Depending on your language server, commands like editor: go to definition and editor: go to type definition will also open a multibuffer if there are multiple possible definitions.
