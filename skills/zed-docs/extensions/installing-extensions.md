# Installing Extensions
Extensions add functionality to Zed, including languages, themes, and AI tools. Browse and install them from the Extension Gallery.
Open the Extension Gallery with cmd-shift-x|ctrl-shift-x , or select "Zed > Extensions" from the menu bar.
## Installation Location
- On macOS, extensions are installed in ~/Library/Application Support/Zed/extensions .
- On Linux, they are installed in either $XDG_DATA_HOME/zed/extensions or ~/.local/share/zed/extensions .
- On Windows, the directory is %LOCALAPPDATA%\Zed\extensions .
This directory contains two subdirectories:
- installed , which contains the source code for each extension.
- work which contains files created by the extension itself, such as downloaded language servers.
