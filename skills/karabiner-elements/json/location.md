# File locations
Karabiner-Elements configuration file paths:
- ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json Main configuration file. Karabiner-Elements watches this file and reload it automatically when it is updated.
- ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications Imported complex_modifications files. You can use them in Karabiner-Elements Settings > Complex Modifications > Add predefined rule.
Karabiner-Elements watches ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json and reloads it if updated.
The mechanism is that Karabiner-Elements watches the parent directory ~/.config/karabiner by using the File System Events API. Thus, Karabiner-Elements fails detecting file updates after you change the parent directory (e.g., recreate the parent directory).
## Log file
Error messages will be output into ~/.local/share/karabiner/log/console_user_server.log if there are errors such as parse error.
You can also view the error messages in Karabiner-Elements Settings > Log.
