# to.send_user_command
send_user_command sends a command to an external program prepared by the user.
This mechanism is designed to let an external program process input with even lower latency than shell_command .
To use send_user_command , you need to prepare an external program separately. There are mainly two approaches.
1. One approach is to build a Swift program that integrates the Karabiner-Elements-user-command-receiver Swift package. A sample program built with this approach is Karabiner-Elements-user-command-server . It receives commands such as set_window_frames and show_window_frames and changes window positions.
2. The other approach is to implement your own UNIX domain datagram server in any programming language you prefer, since send_user_command uses UNIX domain socket datagram communication.
## Example
This example is a configuration for Karabiner-Elements-user-command-server .

## Socket file used for communication
Because send_user_command communicates over UNIX domain sockets, it uses a socket file. You can specify the socket path with endpoint . If omitted, the following path is used.
/Library/Application Support/org.pqrs/tmp/user/{UID}/user_command_receiver.sock
UID is the currently logged-in user’s ID, so the actual path will look like /Library/Application Support/org.pqrs/tmp/user/501/user_command_receiver.sock .
## Tips for implementing your own program
First, it is helpful to verify that your server can receive messages. For example, you can start a server with socat like this.
```
socat -u UNIX-RECVFROM:/tmp/karabiner-elements-user-command-server.sock,fork STDOUT
```
Then, with the following configuration, you can send a command by pressing right_shift + a and confirm it is received by socat . The receiver gets the payload as JSON-serialized data.
